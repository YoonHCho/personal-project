This is my first project outside of coding bootcamp. I wanted to build something on my own without using the dev environment from the bootcamp.

# Technologies Used :technologist:

- UI Framework: **React**
- JavaScript Runtime: **Node.js**
- Server Framework: **Express**
- Database: **PostgreSQL**
- Languages: **JavaScript (ES6)**, **HTML5**, **CSS3**, **SQL**

# Other Requirement :gear:

- PostgreSQL (v15.1) https://www.postgresql.org/download/
- Random Word API Key https://api-ninjas.com/api/randomword

# Getting Started :zap:

Since I am a Windows users, this setup is for windows user only. For Mac users, I apologize, I did not add one since I don't have have a way to test it and to give instructions.

1. Clone repository.

   `https://github.com/YoonHCho/personal-project`

2. Install dependencies in `package.json` with npm.

   `npm install`

3. Download PostgreSql. Go to https://www.postgresql.org/download/windows/ click on "Download the installer" and on the row for version 15.1, click on the download for Windows.

4. Install the PostgreSql and follow the Setup prompt. Once you are at:

- "Password" section, type in the password and remember it. Also, as you read this section of the Setup, superuser is "postgres" which will be your username for PostgreSQL. Hit next
- "Port" section, port number should be 5432, and leave as is. Hit next
- "Advanced Options" section, in locale, defaul should be "[Default locale]" and leave as is. Hit next and let it install.
- Uncheck the "Launch Stack Bilder". Hit finish

5. Set environment variable. Example, My address was C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\15\bin

- Click on Windows and type in environment variable, it should have a result for "Edit the system environment variable" and click on it.
- [You can watch the tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GWZUNCDqNo)

- Once you have done this, you should be able to connect to PostgreSQL.

7. Log in to Postgres from VS code terminal using `psql -U postgres` and when asked for password, type in the password you setup while installing PostgreSQL.

8. Once logged in, create the database replace `nameOfDatabase` with the actual name.

   ```
   createdb -U postgres nameOfDatabase
   ```

   To see the database is created use `\l` Then go into the database use `\c nameOfDatabase`

9. Create Tables. Need to create 3 tables. copy and past following 1 for each table. If table was created successfully, terminal will output "CREATE TABLE" after you paste and hit enter for each table

   first

   ```
   CREATE TABLE users (
     userId SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
     username TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
     email TEXT NOT NULL,
     hashedPassword TEXT NOT NULL,
     joinedAt TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
   );
   ```

   second

   ```
   CREATE TABLE comments (
     commentId SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
     userId INT NOT NULL,
     username TEXT NOT NULL,
     comments TEXT NOT NULL,
     commentedAt TEXT NOT NULL,
     FOREIGN KEY(userId)
       REFERENCES users(userId),
     FOREIGN KEY(username)
       REFERENCES users(username)
   );
   ```

   third

   ```
   CREATE TABLE visits (
     visitId SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
     totalVisits INT NOT NULL,
     todayVisits INT NOT NULL,
     currentDate TEXT NOT NULL
   );
   ```

   then insert a row of default data into table visits. If the data was successfully inserted, should output "INSERT 0 1". For MMMDDYYYY use the first three letter of the month (first letter capitalized). example: if today was January 23, 2023 should be Jan232023.

   ```
   INSERT INTO "visits" ("totalvisits", "todayvisits", "currentdate")
   VALUES (0, 0, 'MMMDDYYYY');
   ```

10. Create a `.env`, should be placed same as `.env.example` and update the environment variable in the `.env` file (replace the the text in brackets( [ ] ) from below example).

    `REACT_APP_RANDOM_WORD_API=[Random-word-API-Key-Here]`

    `TOKEN_SECRET=[someRandomValue12345]`

    `PG_PSW=[yourPostgresPassword]`

    `PG_DATABASE=[nameOfYourDatabase]`

    `PGUSER=[yourPostgresUsername]`

11. Split VS Code terminal so you have two terminals. in one type and enter `npm run start` and on other type and enter `npm run dev` to start the application.

12. App should open browser automatically and be viewable in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`

13. Enjoy the app üòÅ
